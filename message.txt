<i> Dear Sofia,  ♡  (づ_ど)


There's something I've been wanting to share with you, but I'm unsure where to begin.
However, It's been difficult finding the right moment. It's about the bond we share, the moments we've experienced together, and the emotions you evoke within
me, Sofia.


I've poured my heart into this letter, Sofia. I just want you to take the time to read it. Every word comes from a place of sincerity and honesty, and I hope
it helps you understand the depth of my feelings.


Over the past weeks, and month, Every time we're together, there's a warmth in my heart that I can't ignore.
I've come to realize that my feelings for you have grown beyond friendship. Your kindness, intelligence,
and the way you light up a room with your presence have captured my heart.

You always looked stunning when we were in school Sofia, and the time you put a yellow flower behind your ear. I was captivated by your beauty... A flower
behind your ear fits you perfectly, you're so gorgeous at that time i swear to god i don't know how to express my feelings towards you that time, I'm out of 
words. Honestly, you've always been so gorgeous Yana. I've always wanted to put a flower behind your ear too,
but unfortunately I've been too shy to do it. (❀❛ ֊ ❛„)♡

Also that one time we were at Jollibee WAHAHAHAH kadtong nag cr ko tas naa sako ang imong phone tas nagpicture ko kadali, tas pag gawas nako sa cr kay imong kagwapa dayn akong nakita na uy wagyud ko kasabot nganong na ing-ani ko. WAHAHHAHAH superrrrrrrr prettyyy gyud kaayo like as in, like ambot uy unsaon ni pag explain, unang tingin ko lng sayo nung oras na yun parang hihimatayin na ako e. Di nimo makita sakong nawng pero paspas na ang akong heartbeat ato mygadddd

I know this might come as a surprise, and I understand if you need time to process it.
Please know that I value our friendship immensely, and i cherish the moments we've shared together.
I have to admit, I can't stop thinking about you Sofia...... Guess what? You've captured my thoughts completely.

And................................................................................

I like you. <br>
but...............!!!

I also like your flaws.....

your imperfections.....

your personality.....

your vibe.....

your style.....

your worst, and most of all.....

yourrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr smile!..  ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶

but no pressure! you don't need to reciprocate my feelings, Yana. Whether or not you feel the same way, I felt it was important to be honest with you about my feelings. I just need to get this out of my head for my peace of mind. I will fully respect whatever your decision might be.

I want to be with you Sofia.. I want to be a part of your life's journey.. I want to build with you and experience things with you through ups and downs.
I assure you that i won't date you just to pass time. I see potential in you Sofia, I want to pursue you & court you.

I'm aware that after this the situation will be awkward because you & i are friends.
However, i really do have feelings for you. and I'm prepared about what might happen next after telling you about this.
but you know what yana? my feelings for you are genuine and it grows stronger everyday.

If i had to choose between take the risk or lose the chance. I will choose to take the risk, kay wala sa akong vocabulary ang mag sayang ug chance even though i'm really shy type person. I will risk everything for you just to show you how much i like you, adore you, and love you.

I'm not sure if you're entertaining someone, Yana. But I remembered something that you're talking to someone in a different country based on what you've mentioned before. Well If you did, It's really important to be honest with you about my feelings. I anticipate that you might be at a loss of words regarding the letter I'm revealing towards you Sofia. But rest assured, I'm fully aware of the situation, and I possess the capacity to manage it, Yana.  

As we move forward, I feel a stirring of excitement, curious about the twists and turns ahead.
Let's see where our companionship takes us, whether it's a deepening friendship or something beyond.

With sincerest affection, <br>
